# 🚲 Bicycle Online Shop – E-commerce Web Application

## 1. Overview of the Project

In the context of the rapid growth of e-commerce and digital transformation, online shopping has become an essential part of modern consumer behavior. Bicycles and related accessories, traditionally sold through physical stores, are increasingly shifting toward online business models to reach a wider audience, especially among young people and sports enthusiasts.

This project focuses on the development of **"Bicycle Online Shop"** – a fully functional web-based e-commerce system specialized in selling bicycles and accessories. The system supports the complete online shopping process, from product browsing and searching to order placement, secure online payment, and post-purchase management.

Notably, the system integrates:
- A **24/7 chatbot** for automated customer support  
- A **comprehensive admin management panel** for managing products, orders, and users  

Built using a **three-layer architecture** (Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, Data Access Layer) and technologies such as **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL**, this project serves both as a real-world sales platform and a learning model for applying software engineering principles.
